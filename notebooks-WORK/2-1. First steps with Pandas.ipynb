    "| `SciPy` | Scientific computing, statistic tests, and much more! |\n",
    "| `pandas` | Your data manipulation swiss army knife. You'll likely see pandas used in any PyData demo! pandas is built on top of NumPy, so it's **fast**. |\n",
    "| `matplotlib` | An old but powerful data visualisation package, inspired by Matlab. |\n",
    "| `Seaborn` | A newer and easy-to-use but limited data visualisation package, built on top of matplotlib. |\n",
    "| `scikit-learn` | Your one-stop machine learning shop! Classification, regression, clustering, dimensional reduction and more. |\n",
    "| `nltk` and `spacy` | nltk = natural language processing toolkit; spacy is a newer package for natural language processing but very easy to use. |\n",
    "| `statsmodels` | Statistical tests, time series forecasting and more. The \"model formula\" interface will be familiar to R users. |\n",
    "| `requests` and `Beautiful Soup` | `requests` + `Beautiful Soup` = great combination for building web scrapers. |\n",
    "| `Jupyter` | Jupyter itself is a package too. See the latest version at https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/, and upgrade with e.g. `conda install jupyter==1.0.0` |\n",

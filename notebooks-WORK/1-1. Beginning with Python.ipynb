    "These notebooks contain a mix of text and code. This makes it easy to experiment with code and keep documentation like this in the same place. Another nice thing about these notebooks is that you can execute each cell individually and therefore work incrementally with your code. If you want to execute a cell, you can press the \"►\" button above when you have highlighted the cell. Alternatively, you can hit **Shift + Enter** to execute and progress to next cell or alternatively **Ctrl + Enter** (Win) or **Cmd + Enter** (Mac). \n",

    "We will walk you through different aspects of the Python language interactively. Take your time to experiment with it if you like and don't hesitate to ask or Google things. One of the first lessons in programming is using the documentation and information shared by other programmers. Jupyter has another trick, where you can put your cursor into the brackets of a function call such as `print()` and hit **Shift + Tab**. This will let you see the documentation of a function directly in the notebook (*pro-tip*: you can hit it up to four times for different effects).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for Python itself, one of the big strengths of Python is the extensibility. It has a surprising amount of functionality directly within the core language, however, you can `import` almost arbitrary code others make available as libraries. Below you can see a special import that shows you the \"Zen of Python\" a set of guidelines that could guide your programming journey.\""
